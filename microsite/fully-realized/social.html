                        <p>Though quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes,[14] an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening.[7] They also spend time wallowing in mud.[18] They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.[7]</p>

                        <h3>Reproduction</h3>
                        <p>When in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.[37] In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.[29] During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water.[29][34] Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating.[37] The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male.[37] The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.[38] Capybara gestation is 130–150 days, and produces a litter of four young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter.[7] Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group.[19] Alloparenting has been observed in this species.[34] Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.[7]</p>

                    <p>Fun Fact: Capybaras live in large groups of extended family members, with group size varying from 2 to 30 individuals with one dominant breeding male. The mating system is one of resource defense polygyny, where males defend access to foraging resources associated with bodies of water.</p>
