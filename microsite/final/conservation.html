            <div class="text-box">
                <p>Capybaras are not considered a threatened species;[1] their population is stable throughout most of their South American range, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers.[14][19] Capybaras are hunted for their meat and pelts in some areas,[39] and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock. In some areas, they are farmed, which has the effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected. Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.[19]</p>
                <p>Capybaras have adapted well to urbanization in South America. They can be found in many areas in zoos and parks,[27] and may live for 12 years in captivity, more than double their wild lifespan.[19] Capybaras are docile and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.[40] The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria asked Drusillas Park in Alfriston, Sussex, England, to keep the studbook for capybaras, to monitor captive populations in Europe. The studbook includes information about all births, deaths and movements of capybaras, as well as how they are related.[41]</p>
                <p>Capybaras are farmed for meat and skins in South America.[42] The meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some areas, while in other areas it is considered an important source of protein.[7] In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.[43] After several attempts a 1784 Papal bull was obtained that allowed the consumption of capybara during Lent.[44][45] There is widespread perception in Venezuela that consumption of capybaras is exclusive to rural people.[46]</p>
                <p> Although it is illegal in some states,[47] capybaras are occasionally kept as pets in the United States.[48][b] The image of a capybara features on the 2-peso coin of Uruguay.[50] In Japan, following the lead of Izu Shaboten Zoo in 1982,[51] multiple establishments or zoos in Japan that raise capybaras have adopted the practice of having them relax in onsen during the winter. They are seen as an attraction by Japanese people.[51] Capybaras became popular in Japan due to the popular cartoon character Kapibara-san.[52]</p>
                <p> In August 2021, Argentine and international media reported that capybaras had been causing serious problems for residents of Nordelta, an affluent gated community north of Buenos Aires built atop wetland habitat. This inspired social media users to jokingly adopt the capybara as a symbol of class struggle and communism.[53][54] Brazilian Lyme-like borreliosis likely involves capybaras as reservoirs and Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus ticks as vectors.[55]</p>

                    <p>Fun Fact: With an average weight of around 50 kilograms, these barrel-shaped mammals are certainly no field mice—weighing anywhere between 35 and 70 kilograms. Although female Capybaras are a little heavier than their male counterparts.</p>
