            <p class="stage">[Verse 1]</p>
            <p>I miss the days when life was so simple</p>
            <p>Felt like the glass was always half-full</p>
            <p>Where did that go?</p>
            <p>And every second with you was so special</p>
            <p>Back when we didn't fear the unknowns</p>
            <p>But that was long ago</p>
            <br>
            <p class="stage">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            <p>Who can say where the path will go?</p>
            <p>Philosophers guess, but they just don't know</p>
            <p>Maybe that's why</p>
            <br>
            <p class="stage">[Chorus]</p>
            <p>We had our heads in the clouds</p>
            <p>Thought we had it all figured out</p>
            <p>Planning to fly away</p>
            <p>To escape everything on the ground</p>
            <p>But like a plane up in space</p>
            <p>We slowly drifted away</p>
            <p>And every plan that we made</p>
            <p>And dream that we chased</p>
            <p>Are just memories now</p>
            <p>They're just memories now</p>
            <br>
            <p class="stage">[Verse 2]</p>
            <p>I'm not sure where everything went wrong</p>
            <p>But I know that we landed where we both belong</p>
            <p>I just wish we weren't scared to say</p>
            <p>That there's expiration dates on the friends you make</p>
            <p>As hard as that may sound</p>
            <br>
            <p class="stage">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            <p>Who can say where the path will go?</p>
            <p>Philosophers guess, but they just don't know</p>
