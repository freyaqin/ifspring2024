                <li style = "color:cornflowerblue;"> <i>About Me</i>  
                    <p>
                        My name is Freya Qin, a sophomore majoring in Fashion Design.</p>
                </li>
                <li style = "color:cornflowerblue;"> <i>My Background & Interest</i>
                    <p>I have been curious about UI/UX design, so I am pursuing a minor in HCI.</p>
                </li>
                <li style = "color:cornflowerblue;"> <i>HTML/CSS/JS Experiences </i>
                    <p>In Introduction to Computer Science, I acquired some entry-level knowledge about JS. However, I do not consider myself proficient in coding in general and would like to work on it in this class. </p>
                </li>
                <li style = "color:cornflowerblue;"> <i>My Goal for the Class</i>
                    <p>I would like to learn about the fundamentals of interaction design and familiarize myself with HTML and CSS in this class.</p>
                </li>
                <li style = "color:cornflowerblue;"> <i>Screen vs. Paper</i>
                    <p>Designing on screen is different from creating on paper because designing on paper is more spontaneous. Screen design would require more logic as the construction order is more linear. </p>
                </li>
                <li style = "color:cornflowerblue;"> <i>Website with Effective Design</i>
                    <p>A website that exemplifies good design is the <a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a> website. I like the index system they established by assigning different colors to articles, which helps to reinforce the content hierarchy. The row format that travels the entire page breaks out of the traditional grid systems for sites, allowing the audience to experience more interaction when reading through the article titles. </p>
                </li>
                <li style = "color:cornflowerblue;"> <i>Website with Effective Communication</i>
                    <p>The website <a href="https://www.whatismissing.org/">whatismissing.org</a> by Maya Lin effectively encaptures a linear experience that also bestows the audience with a sense of interactive exploration. The navigation process helps convey the resonance Lin tries to evoke in her audience, calling them to action for global issues like climate crisis. </p>
                </li>
                <li style = "color:cornflowerblue;"> <i>Website that Works Well</i>
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities</a> website works well, using a cohesive design style, color schemes, and visual treatments that allow for a “character” to be built into the site. Moreover, its navigational structure also points out a logical user journey for them to take the test before learning more about their results.</p>
